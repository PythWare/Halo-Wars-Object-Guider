# Object Guider Info
Ever got tired of always being limited to XML editing for objects.xml? Ever wished you could visually see coordinates/offsets of objects and their childobjects instead of having to endlessly open/close the game for every small change just to see if you got it right? Well Object Guider provides a visual way of showing you the object and its ChildObjects. You can see a visual guide and even edit/add childobjects. This makes it way easier/quicker to design custom bases, buildings, etc. Ever wanted walls easily and neatly placed around your base? Object Guider can make that super easy. Object Guider isn't ready to release yet but i'm creating the repository so it's established.

It pretty much makes objects.xml modding feel like, layout designing/guiding. It honestly feels like playing Stronghold Crusader for me especially when making castles/walled off bases.

# Polyline mode

Click parts of the canvas and then click fill after having the type and childobject selected (at the bottom right), the Object Guider will auto place the ChildObjects based on the drawn lines.

# Other Features

Magnet toggle for connecting ChildObjects easily (it auto attaches childobjects while dragging them), search filter for finding objects, zoom support, moving around canvas, toggable grid option, updating childobjects with the guider, adding more childobjects, automatically updating offsets of childobjects as they're dragged around, syncing to xml file (saves all your changes and correctly adds the new/updated Object/ChildObjects), etc.
